============

Building
--------

$> mkdir build
$> cd build
$> cmake ..
$> make

For a debug build, replace the cmake command above with
$> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

For faster builds, you can also invoke make with the -jn argument, 
replace "n" with the number of parallel build jobs (e.g. -j2 on a 
dual-core machine).

Development
-----------

Main development is done using Qt Creator. Simply open the CMakeLists.txt 
in this directory in Qt Creator and start coding.
