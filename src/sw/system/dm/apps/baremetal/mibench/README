MiBench for OpTiMSoC
====================

This folder contains (parts of the) the MiBench 1.0 benchmark suite as 
available from http://www.eecs.umich.edu/mibench/ with the necessary changes
for it to run on an OpTiMSoC system.

All benchmarks required some changes to compile or to remove the need for input
data either from STDIN or from a file. This data has been compiled-in instead.
Apart from those changes, the benchmarks are left as they are and the input
data is the same as in the original benchmark. A CHANGES.OpTiMSoC in each
benchmark folder describes in detail which changes have been made.
