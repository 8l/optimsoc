The following changes were done in comparison to the original MiBench 
distribution to adapt the testbench for OpTiMSoC.

- Removed files: COMPILE, runme_small.sh, runme_large.sh
- Moved the original Makefile to Makefile.host
  Run it with
  $> make -f Makefile.host
  to get a reference output to compare OpTiMSoC to.
- Created new Makefile for OpTiMSoC, utilizing only the small data set
