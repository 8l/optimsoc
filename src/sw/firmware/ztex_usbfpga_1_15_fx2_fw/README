Firmware for the ZTEX USB-FPGA Module 1.15
==========================================

This is a basic firmware for the Cypress EZ-USB FX2 chip to enable 
communication between the OpTiMSoC debug system and a host computer using
the USB interface.

It has been tested on the ZTEX USB-FPGA Modules 1.15b and 1.15d.

Building
--------

To compile this firmware, the ZTEX EZ-USB FX2 SDK is necessary, available at
http://www.ztex.de/downloads/#firmware_kit
Unpack the SDK and set the ZTEX_INCLUDE environment variable to the
include-directory and add the bin-directory to your PATH. 

You also need the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC), which is often available 
from your distribution's packet repository.

Then call "make" to build the firmware.

On Debian/Ubuntu, the following commands will give you a working firmware
build:
$> # assuming you're in the directory where you found this README
$> apt-get install sdcc
$> wget http://www.ztex.de/downloads/ztex-120412.tar.bz2
$> tar -xf ztex-120412.tar.bz2
$> export ZTEX_INCLUDE=`pwd`/ztex/include 
$> export PATH=`pwd`/ztex/bin:$PATH
$> make


Flashing
--------

After building the firmware, you need to flash it to the ZTEX board. Connect
the board to your PC (and only one board at the time), and run
$> make flash
to copy the firmware to the board.

If you get any permission denied errors, you might need to adjust your udev 
rules to allow access to the USB device for regular users, or just run the
make flash command as root (or any other user that has access to the device). 

To check if the firmware loaded successfully, run
$> lsusb -vd 221a:0100 | grep 'iProduct\|iManufacturer'
  iManufacturer           1 TUM LIS
  iProduct                2 OpTiMSoC - ZTEX USB 1.15

If you get output as shown above, the device has been successfully flashed
and you can now use e.g. optimsoc_cli to connect to the device. The firmware
is permanently stored in the EEPROM and does not need to be re-flashed after
the device has been powered down.
