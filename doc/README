This folder contains documentation for OpTiMSoC.

Currently, the following documentation is available:
- OpTiMSoC User Guide (in the folder user_guide)

The documentation is written in LaTeX. It needs to be transformed into PDF or
HTML for easier reading. For this task, a Makefile is added to each
documentation folder.

But first, install all required tools:
- a LaTeX distribution (e.g. texlive)
- LaTeXML (for HTML output)

On Debian/Ubuntu, the following command should install all prerequisites:
$> sudo apt-get install latexml texlive-latex-recommended

To build the documentation, change into the documentation folder and run make.

Example: Building the User Guide
$> cd user_guide
$> make

After building, you can view the user_guide.pdf in your preferred PDF viewer
or run
$> firefox html/user_guide.xhtml
to open the User Guide in HTML format in Firefox.
