Open Tiled Manycore System-on-Chip (OpTiMSoC) is library-based
framework that allows you to build you own Manycore. So called ``Tiled
Manycores'' are based on a regular Network-on-Chip to which different
tiles are connected. Such tiles can contain processing elements,
memory, I/O devices etc.

OpTiMSoC is based on LISNoC, an open source Network-on-Chip and other
open source hardware components. In future, this set of components
will be continuously extended and you can easily integrate your own
components. A variety of target platforms, such as FPGA boards,
emulation platforms and simulations will in the future be supported.

This chapter will give an insight on the plans and roadmap of OpTiMSoC
and finally give an overview of what is contained in the current
release.
