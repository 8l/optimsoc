\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:getstarted-requirements}

Before you get started with OpTiMSoC you should notice that external
tools and libraries might be required that are in some cases
proprietary and cost some money. Although OpTiMSoC is developed at an
university with access to many EDA tools, we aim to always provide
tool flows and support for open and free tools, but especially when it
comes to synthesis such alternatives are even not available.

\subsection{Cross Compiler}
\label{sec:getstarted-requirements-crosscompiler}

You will need the \verb|or32-elf-gcc| cross compiler to compile your
code for the OpenRISC processor. Precompiled libraries can currently
be found here:
\url{http://opencores.org/or1k/OpenRISC_GNU_tool_chain}. This release
has been tested with the current snapshot:

\url{ftp://ocuser:ocuser@openrisc.opencores.org/toolchain/openrisc-toolchain-ocsvn-rev789.tar.bz2}

Alternatively, you will need to build the cross compiler manually (can
take some hours).

You will need an additional script \verb|bin2vmem| to initialize the
memory during simulation. It is distributed with ORPSoC and also
available in the OpTiMSoC repository under \verb|tools/utils|. Just
compile it

\begin{verbatim}
> gcc -o bin2vmem bin2vmem.c
\end{verbatim}

and install it somewhere in your PATH.

\subsection{Simulation Tools}

\begin{itemize}
\item Mentor Modelsim (tested with 10.1 and later)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Synthesis Tools}

\begin{itemize}
\item Synopsys FPGA Synthesis (Synplify), tested with F-2012.03 and
  later
\item Xilinx ISE, tested with 13.4 and later
\end{itemize}

\section{LISNoC}

LISNoC is the Network-on-Chip implementation OpTiMSoC builds on. You
can find LISNoC at \url{http://www.lisnoc.org}. The source code is
available from a git repository.

This document is written to match the tagged commit available in the
repository. You need to create a local copy of the repository (line
1). It is recommended that you switch to the tag this document is
tested with (line 2):

\begin{verbatim}
> git clone http://lis.ei.tum.de/git/lisnoc.git
> cd lisnoc; git checkout rel20130128
\end{verbatim}

Two environment variables are needed in the following: \verb|LISNOC|
and \verb|LISNOC_RTL|. You should either set them in your environment
or start your session by sourcing a script in the LISNoC toplevel:

\begin{verbatim}
> source source.sh
\end{verbatim}

\section{OpTiMSoC}

OpTiMSoC itself is a repository that contains all modules and software
required to work with OpTiMSoC except LISNoC. The current version and
updated information on OpTiMSoC can be found at the OpTiMSoC website:
\url{http://www.optimsoc.org}.

The sources are again available as git repository. Again, you need to
create a local copy of the repository (line 1) and it is recommended that
you switch to the tag this document is tested with (line 2):

\begin{verbatim}
> git clone http://lis.ei.tum.de/git/optimsoc.git
> cd optimsoc; git checkout rel20130128
\end{verbatim}

Again, two environment variables are needed: \verb|OPTIMSOC| and
\verb|OPTIMSOC_RTL|. As for LISNoC, you should either set them in your
environment or start your session by sourcing a script in the OpTiMSoC
toplevel folder:

\begin{verbatim}
> source source.sh
\end{verbatim}
